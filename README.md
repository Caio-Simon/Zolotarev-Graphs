# Zolotarev-Graphs
Zolotarev Graphs are developed in the article "Rational Eigenfunctions of the Hecke Operators". Here we give a code to compute such graphs.

In the code "Zolotarev Graphs.py" you must give two numbers n and L to compute the Zolotarev Graph Z(n,L). The graph will be saved as an image with the name "Z(n,L).png" in the same folder as "Zolotarev Graphs.py". So, for example, if I give the numbers n=2 and L=4, the code will compute an image of Z(2,4) and will save a file named "Z(2,4).png".
